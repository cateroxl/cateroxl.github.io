   <p>"Think of Prealgebra as the bridge between arithmetic and algebra."</p> 

   <p><b>Arithmetic</b> refers to the most elementary calculations of real numbers, namely: addition, subtraction, multiplication, division, exponentation and extraction of roots. It's a great toolbox in solving simple problems like counting how many of each of the fruits on the list to buy or how much money to give to the vendor. </p>

   <p>Learning arithmetic will help improve our number sense, mental estimation and pattern-solving skills that are all critical for problem-solving, especially in our digital day and age.</p>

   <p>Computers and calculators only work on what we, humans, give to them. Often times, it's way convenient to use these machines to do the work, to calculate for us. That's what they're built for anyway. But again, they rely to us for input. Us, humans.</p>

   <p><i>We make mistakes.</i></p>

   <p>Mistakes that can lead to massive losses. Having good estimation skills and number sense will help decrease the odds of that.</p>

   <p>Our world is complex. The problems we'll be dealing with will not always be simple, we'll encounter complex and complicated ones as we grow older. There's a difference among simple, complex, and complicated problems. Solutions to simple problems only work well on simple problems. The same goes for complex and complicated problems. Make no mistake in thinking complex and complicated are essentially the same, they're not. You can read about it <a href="https://blog.usejournal.com/7-differences-between-complex-and-complicated-fa44e0844606">here</a>.</p>

   <p>If arithmetic is for simple problems, what do we use for complex like analysing consumer markets and complicated problems like upgrading a payment system? </p>

   <p><b> Algebra.</b></p>

   <p>"Algebra is the language of all advanced mathematics."</p>

   <p>Algebra is a more advanced toolbox; it allows us to generalise arithmetic concepts so we can use it on other types of problems.  But before we could make use of algebra, we have to understand the rules of the most elementary of calculations-the rules of arithmetic.</p> 

   <p>It's important to: "start thinking not just <i>how</i> to perform various calculations, but <i>why</i> the techniques used in those calculations work. Understanding why mathematics works is the key to solving harder problems. If you only understand how techniques work but not why they work, you'll have a lot more difficulty modifying those techniques to solve more complicated problems."</p>

   <p>This is where <b>prealgebra</b> comes in; it prepares us for algebra and helps us develop a basic logical understanding of concepts that comes handy in our everyday life...

   <p>Budgeting.</p>

   <p>Time management.</p>

   <p>Cooking.</p>

   <p>And of course, in our pursuit of becoming an efficient developer, an efficient problem solver.</p>

   <p>Before we could dive into the advanced and more advanced concepts of mathematics, we must first lay the foundations. <b>We need to understand the basics, and to never estimate its power.</b> Having a good understanding of the basics will give us enough strength to persist and confidence to face the challenges in our way.</p>

   <p><b>We need a solid foundation to reach the stars.</b></p>
